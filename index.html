<h1>Anchors of Academia</h1>
<p>Coming Soon..</p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p align='justify'>Our mission statement is to connect students and professionals involved in academic research with patient donors. We feel academic researchers have a lack of understanding of what patients endure in the bedside, while patients who donate samples often consent without knowing for what or where their bodily specimens are going. Connecting academic researchers with these selfless patients will not only provide patients with a better understanding of how they are helping advance scientific research, but additionally, provide academic researchers with a patient perspective on the difficulties of enduring maladies related to their research. Additionally, Anchors of Academia aims to highlight the historical impact clinical samples and patient donors have had on academic research. While patients involved in clinical trials have been held in admiration, and rightfully so, patient donors have long been forgotten in this regard. When signing consent, patients are often informed that the samples used by these academic institutions will not be used for the purpose of helping them, but rather used for research into understanding such diseases. This patient altruism has long been overlooked by academic institutions and researchers themselves. Additionally, we feel that providing a platform for researchers and patients to connect will provide the perspective needed to rejuvenate those conducting translational academic research.</p>
