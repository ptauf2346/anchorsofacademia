    <h2 align='center'>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p align='justify'>Patients are often disconnected from the research they donate their bodies to, 
      while academic researchers often forget the broader impacts of their work. 
      Establishing a community between these groups can provide education for patients and a valuable perspective for researchers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="quote-one">
    <p>Over 60% of participants stated they personally work with patient derived biospecimens, in a survey of <u>51 biomedical researchers</u> at <b>Vanderbilt University</b>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="three">
    <p align="justify">Academic researchers lack understanding of what patients endure in the bedside, 
      while patients who donate samples often consent without knowing how their bodily 
      specimens are being used and towards what aim. Connecting academic researchers with 
      these selfless patients will not only provide patients with a better understanding 
      of how they are contributing to scientific research, but provide academic researchers 
      with a patient perspective on the difficulties of enduring maladies within their field of study.

    <p>In the last 100 years, <b>over 570,000 </b>peer reviewed scientific articles have been published that have used or referenced <u>“patient samples”</u>.</p>

  <div class="six">
    <p>Despite this, no organization exists to acknowledge these patients, or at the very least, enumerate their impacts in scientific research. 
      While egregious acts of patient wrongdoings are now few and far between thanks to institutional regulations, the role of the patient is still 
      heavily overlooked in scientific publications. Articulating this idea to the Vanderbilt community will hopefully start a paradigm shift within 
      the scientific community on how we value patient samples in research. </p>
